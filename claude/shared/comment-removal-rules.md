- Look for comments that are obvious or redundant and remove them. Examples of comments that can be removed include:
  - Commented out code.
  - Comments that describe edits like "added", "removed", or "changed" something.
  - Explanations that are just obvious because they are close to method names.
- Do not delete all comments:
  - Don't remove comments that start with TODO/INFO/HACK
  - Don't remove comments if doing so would make a scope empty, like an empty catch block or an empty else block.
  - Don't remove comments that suppress linters or formatters, like `// prettier-ignore`
- If you find any end-of-line comments, move them above the code they describe. Comments should go on their own lines.
