- I replaced `cd` with `zoxide` (`z`). Use `command cd` to change directories.
  - This is the only command that needs to be prefixed with `command`.
  - Don't prefix `git` with `command git`.
- Try not to use `cd` or `zoxide` at all. It's usually not necessary with CLI commands.
  - Don't run `cd <dir> && git <subcommand>`
  - Prefer `git -C <dir> <subcommand`
