- When creating a branch, use the format `<name>/<ticket>/<description>`
    - Ticket name should be the JIRA ticket name (e.g. `proj-1234`)
    - Exception: `noticket` for minor changes instead of ticket name
    - The description should be a kebab-case task name based on the todo item (e.g., "auth-feature", "database-migration")
- 📦 Stage individually using `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
  - Only stage changes that you remember editing yourself.
  - Avoid commands like `git add .` and `git add -A` and `git commit -am` which stage all changes
- Use single quotes around file names containing `$` characters
  - Example: `git add 'app/routes/_protected.foo.$bar.tsx'`
- 🐛 If the user's prompt was a compiler or linter error, create a `fixup` commit message.
- Otherwise:
- Commit messages should:
  - Use Conventional Commits style (e.g. prefix with `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`)
  - Start with a present-tense verb (fix, add, implement, etc.)
  - Not include adjectives that sound like praise (comprehensive, best practices, essential)
  - Be concise (60-120 characters)
  - Be a single line
      - Don't add a commit description
  - Sound like the title of the issue we resolved, and not include the implementation details we learned during implementation
  - Describe the intent of the original prompt
- Commit messages should not include a Claude attribution footer
  - Don't write: 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  - Don't write: Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
- Echo exactly this: Ready to commit: `git commit --message "<message>"`
- 🚀 Run git commit without confirming again with the user.
- If pre-commit hooks fail, then there are now local changes
  - `git add` those changes and try again
  - Never use `git commit --no-verify`
  - There is a pre-commit step to block committing 'TODO' lines in a commit patch
      - If a TODO line found, and they were not created by you, remove the lines from the patch
- You are not allowed to run `git push` -- I will do this after verifying changes
